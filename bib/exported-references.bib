abstract = {The signing authors together with the journal Systematic and Applied Microbiology ({SAM}) have started an ambitious project that has been conceived to provide a useful tool especially for the scientific microbial taxonomist community. The aim of what we have called "The All-Species Living Tree" is to reconstruct a single {16S} {rRNA} tree harboring all sequenced type strains of the hitherto classified species of Archaea and Bacteria. This tree is to be regularly updated by adding the species with validly published names that appear monthly in the Validation and Notification lists of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. For this purpose, the {SAM} executive editors, together with the responsible teams of the {ARB}, {SILVA}, and {LPSN} projects (www.arb-home.de, www.arb-silva.de, and www.bacterio.cict.fr, respectively), have prepared a {16S} {rRNA} database containing over 6700 sequences, each of which represents a single type strain of a classified species up to 31 December 2007. The selection of sequences had to be undertaken manually due to a high error rate in the names and information fields provided for the publicly deposited entries. In addition, from among the often occurring multiple entries for a single type strain, the best-quality sequence was selected for the project. The living tree database that {SAM} now provides contains corrected entries and the best-quality sequences with a manually checked alignment. The tree reconstruction has been performed by using the maximum likelihood algorithm {RAxML}. The tree provided in the first release is a result of the calculation of a single dataset containing 9975 single entries, 6728 corresponding to type strain gene sequences, as well as 3247 additional high-fquality sequences to give robustness to the reconstruction. Trees are dynamic structures that change on the basis of the quality and availability of the data used for their calculation. Therefore, the addition of new type strain sequences in further subsequent releases may help to resolve certain branching orders that appear ambiguous in this first release. On the web sites: www.elsevier.de/syapm and www.arb-silva.de/living-tree, the All-Species Living Tree team will release a regularly updated database compatible with the {ARB} software environment containing the whole {16S} {rRNA} dataset used to reconstruct "The All-Species Living Tree". As a result, the latest reconstructed phylogeny will be provided. In addition to the {ARB} file, a readable multi-{FASTA} universal sequence editor file with the complete alignment will be provided for those not using {ARB}. There is also a complete set of supplementary tables and figures illustrating the selection procedure and its outcome. It is expected that the All-Species Living Tree will help to improve future classification efforts by simplifying the selection of the correct type strain sequences. For queries, information updates, remarks on the dataset or tree reconstructions shown, a contact email address has been created (living-tree@arb-silva.de). This provides an entry point for anyone from the scientific community to provide additional input for the construction and improvement of the first tree compiling all sequenced type strains of all prokaryotic species for which names had been validly published.}

The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features.

Patterns of spatial variation in microbiota composition may help explain Staphylococcus aureus colonization and reveal interspecies and species-host interactions. To assess the biogeography of the nasal microbiota, we sampled healthy subjects, representing both S. aureus carriers and noncarriers at three nasal sites (anterior naris, middle meatus, and sphenoethmoidal recess). Phylogenetic compositional and sparse linear discriminant analyses revealed communities that differed according to site epithelium type and S. aureus culture-based carriage status. Corynebacterium accolens and C. pseudodiphtheriticum were identified as the most important microbial community determinants of S. aureus carriage, and competitive interactions were only evident at sites with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. In vitro cocultivation experiments provided supporting evidence of interactions among these species. These results highlight spatial variation in nasal microbial communities and differences in community composition between S. aureus carriers and noncarriers. Copyright \copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent cause of infections in both the community and hospital. Worldwide, the increasing resistance of this pathogen to various antibiotics complicates treatment of S aureus infections. Effective measures to prevent S aureus infections are therefore urgently needed. It has been shown that nasal carriers of S aureus have an increased risk of acquiring an infection with this pathogen. The nose is the main ecological niche where S aureus resides in human beings, but the determinants of the carrier state are incompletely understood. Eradication of S aureus from nasal carriers prevents infection in specific patient categories-eg, haemodialysis and general surgery patients. However, recent randomised clinical trials in orthopaedic and non-surgical patients failed to show the efficacy of eliminating S aureus from the nose to prevent subsequent infection. Thus we must elucidate the mechanisms behind S aureus nasal carriage and infection to be able to develop new preventive strategies. We present an overview of the current knowledge of the determinants (both human and bacterial) and risks of S aureus nasal carriage. Studies on the population dynamics of S aureus are also summarised.}

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing based techniques, such as {16S} {rRNA} gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities - be they from the world's oceans or the human gut. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between members of these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, it has been known since the days of Karl Pearson that the analysis of the type of data generated by such techniques (referred to as compositional data) can produce unreliable results since the observed data take the form of relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, we show that such compositional effects can be widespread and severe: in some real data sets many of the correlations among taxa can be artifactual, and true correlations may even appear with opposite sign. Additionally, we show that community diversity is the key factor that modulates the acuteness of such compositional effects, and develop a new approach, called {SparCC} (available at https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc), which is capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. To illustrate a potential application of {SparCC}, we infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. Using the {SparCC} network as a reference, we estimated that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60\% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data, and, as predicted, most of the erroneous links are found in the samples with the lowest diversity.}

We sought to understand the dynamics of respiratory tract microbiota following intubation and the relationship between microbial community structure and infection. {RESULTS}: We enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal ({OP}) and deep endotracheal ({ET}) secretions were sampled within 24 h of intubation and every 48-72 h thereafter. Bacterial community profiling was carried out by purifying {DNA}, {PCR} amplification of {16S} ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The clinical diagnosis of {LRTI} ascertained by chart review correlated with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon. Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma parvum and Enterococcus faecalis. {CONCLUSIONS}: Longitudinal analysis of respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill patients provides insight into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of {LRTI}. {16S} {rRNA} gene sequencing of endotracheal aspirate samples holds promise for expanded pathogen identification.}

Nasal colonization with {MRSA} is associated with clinical {MRSA} infection and can be reliably detected using the nasal swab {PCR} assay. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the nasal swab {MRSA} {PCR} in predicting {MRSA} pneumonia. A retrospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary care center from January 2009 to July 2011. All patients with confirmed pneumonia who had both a nasal swab {MRSA} {PCR} test and a bacterial culture within predefined time intervals were included in the study. These data were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for clinically confirmed {MRSA} pneumonia. Four hundred thirty-five patients met inclusion criteria. The majority of cases were classified as either health care-associated ({HCAP}) (54.7\%) or community-acquired ({CAP}) (34\%) pneumonia. {MRSA} nasal {PCR} was positive in 62 (14.3\%) cases. {MRSA} pneumonia was confirmed by culture in 25 (5.7\%) cases. The {MRSA} {PCR} assay demonstrated 88.0\% sensitivity and 90.1\% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 35.4\% and a negative predictive value of 99.2\%. In patients with pneumonia, the {MRSA} {PCR} nasal swab has a poor positive predictive value but an excellent negative predictive value for {MRSA} pneumonia in populations with low {MRSA} pneumonia incidence. In cases of culture-negative pneumonia where initial empirical antibiotics include an {MRSA}-active agent, a negative {MRSA} {PCR} swab can be reasonably used to guide antibiotic de-escalation.}

Eighty-five patients with hospital-acquired {SAB} were matched to 85 control patients with a similar primary diagnosis at admission (matched controls). Of these, 62 patients with hospital-acquired {SAB} were compared with 118 other patients with a similar time of admission, who were randomly selected with no clinical evidence of {SAB} (unmatched controls). {RESULTS}: The incidence of hospital-acquired {SAB} was 0.71 per 1000 hospital admissions. The presence of a central venous catheter (odds ratio, 6.9; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 2.8-17.0), anemia (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% {CI}, 1.4-7.6), and hyponatremia (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% {CI}, 1.5-7.0) was significantly associated with hospital-acquired {SAB} in a conditional and a usual logistic regression analysis. Nasal carriage was not an independent risk factor, but nasal carriers among patients in surgery (odds ratio, 4.0; 95\% {CI}, 1.3-13.0) had a significantly higher risk for hospital-acquired {SAB} compared with matched and unmatched controls. The presence of hospital-acquired {SAB} increased the mortality rate 2.4-fold (95\% {CI}, 1.1-5.2). {CONCLUSIONS}: The presence of a central venous catheter is an important risk factor, and hyponatremia and anemia are associated with the development of hospital-acquired {SAB}. Furthermore, hospital-acquired {SAB} in itself increases mortality.}

Yet, statistical artifacts commonly plague the analysis of relative abundance data. Here, we introduce the {PhILR} transform, which incorporates microbial evolutionary models with the isometric log-ratio transform to allow off-the-shelf statistical tools to be safely applied to microbiota surveys. We demonstrate that analyses of community-level structure can be applied to {PhILR} transformed data with performance on benchmarks rivaling or surpassing standard tools. Additionally, by decomposing distance in the {PhILR} transformed space, we identified neighboring clades that may have adapted to distinct human body sites. Decomposing variance revealed that covariation of bacterial clades within human body sites increases with phylogenetic relatedness. Together, these findings illustrate how the {PhILR} transform combines statistical and phylogenetic models to overcome compositional data challenges and enable evolutionary insights relevant to microbial communities.}

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus-human interactions result in a continuum of outcomes from commensalism to pathogenesis. S. aureus is a clinically important pathogen that asymptomatically colonizes \~25\% of humans as a member of the nostril and skin microbiota, where it resides with other bacteria including commensal Corynebacterium species. Commensal Corynebacterium spp. are also positively correlated with S. aureus in chronic polymicrobial diabetic foot infections, distinct from acute monomicrobial S. aureus infections. Recent work by our lab and others indicates that microbe-microbe interactions between S. aureus and human skin/nasal commensals, including Corynebacterium species, affect S. aureus behavior and fitness. Thus, we hypothesized that S. aureus interactions with Corynebacterium spp. diminish S. aureus virulence. We tested this by assaying for changes in S. aureus gene expression during in vitro mono- versus coculture with Corynebacterium striatum, a common skin and nasal commensal. We observed a broad shift in S. aureus gene transcription during in vitro growth with C. striatum, including increased transcription of genes known to exhibit increased expression during human nasal colonization and decreased transcription of virulence genes. S. aureus uses several regulatory pathways to transition between commensal and pathogenic states. One of these, the quorum signal accessory gene regulator (agr) system, was strongly inhibited in response to Corynebacterium spp. Phenotypically, S. aureus exposed to C. striatum exhibited increased adhesion to epithelial cells, reflecting a commensal state, and decreased hemolysin activity, reflecting an attenuation of virulence. Consistent with this, S. aureus displayed diminished fitness in experimental in vivo coinfection with C. striatum when compared to monoinfection. These data support a model in which S. aureus shifts from virulence toward a commensal state when exposed to commensal Corynebacterium species.}

abstract = {The human microbiome can play a key role in host susceptibility to pathogens, including in the nasal cavity, a site favored by Staphylococcus aureus. However, what determines our resident nasal microbiota-the host or the environment-and can interactions among nasal bacteria determine S. aureus colonization? Our study of 46 monozygotic and 43 dizygotic twin pairs revealed that nasal microbiota is an environmentally derived trait, but the host's sex and genetics significantly influence nasal bacterial density. Although specific taxa, including lactic acid bacteria, can determine S. aureus colonization, their negative interactions depend on thresholds of absolute abundance. These findings demonstrate that nasal microbiota is not fixed by host genetics and opens the possibility that nasal microbiota may be manipulated to prevent or eliminate S. aureus colonization.}

abstract = {Background: Airway-colonization by Staphylococcus aureus predisposes to the development of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis ({VAT}) and ventilator-associated pneumonia ({VAP}). Despite extensive antibiotic treatment of intensive care unit patients, limited data are available on the efficacy of antibiotics on bacterial airway colonization and/or prevention of infections. Therefore, microbiologic responses to antibiotic treatment were evaluated in ventilated patients. Methods: Results of semiquantitative analyses of S. aureus burden in serial endotracheal-aspirate ({ETA}) samples and {VAT}/{VAP} diagnosis were correlated to antibiotic treatment. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of relevant antibiotics using serially collected isolates were evaluated. Results: Forty-eight mechanically ventilated patients who were S. aureus positive by {ETA} samples and treated with relevant antibiotics for at least 2 consecutive days were included in the study. Vancomycin failed to reduce methicillin-resistant S. aureus ({MRSA}) or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ({M\SSA}) burden in the airways. Oxacillin was ineffective for {M\SSA} colonization in approximately 30\% of the patients, and responders were typically coadministered additional antibiotics. Despite antibiotic exposure, 15 of the 39 patients (approximately 38\%) colonized only by S. aureus and treated with appropriate antibiotic for at least 2 days still progressed to {VAP}. Importantly, no change in antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus isolates was observed during treatment. Staphylococcus aureus colonization levels inversely correlated with the presence of normal respiratory flora. Conclusions: Antibiotic treatment is ineffective in reducing S. aureus colonization in the lower airways and preventing {VAT} or {VAP}. Staphylococcus aureus is in competition for colonization with the normal respiratory flora. To improve patient outcomes, alternatives to antibiotics are urgently needed. \copyright The Author 2017.

We examined the bacterial microbiota of the nostril and posterior wall of the oropharynx from seven healthy adults using two culture-independent methods, a {16S} {rRNA} gene microarray ({PhyloChip}) and {16S} {rRNA} gene clone libraries. While the bacterial microbiota of the oropharynx was richer than that of the nostril, the oropharyngeal microbiota varied less among participants than did nostril microbiota. A few phyla accounted for the majority of the bacteria detected at each site: Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the nostril and Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx. Compared to culture-independent surveys of microbiota from other body sites, the microbiota of the nostril and oropharynx show distinct phylum-level distribution patterns, supporting niche-specific colonization at discrete anatomical sites. In the nostril, the distribution of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes was reminiscent of that of skin, though Proteobacteria were much less prevalent. The distribution of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx was most similar to that in saliva, with more Proteobacteria than in the distal esophagus or mouth. While Firmicutes were prevalent at both sites, distinct families within this phylum dominated numerically in each. At both sites there was an inverse correlation between the prevalences of Firmicutes and another phylum: in the oropharynx, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and in the nostril, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. In the nostril, this inverse correlation existed between the Firmicutes family Staphylococcaceae and Actinobacteria families, suggesting potential antagonism between these groups.}

In our motivating data, ocean microbiome samples were collected from the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf, Monterey Bay at multiple time points and then {16S} ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}) sequenced. We develop a Bayesian semiparametric regression model to investigate how microbial abundance and succession change with covarying physical and biological factors including algal bloom and domoic acid concentration level using {16S} {rRNA} sequencing data. A generalized linear regression model is built using the Laplace prior, a sparse inducing prior, to improve estimation of covariate effects on mean abundances of microbial species represented by operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}). A nonparametric prior model is used to facilitate borrowing strength across {OTUs}, across samples and across time points. It flexibly estimates baseline mean abundances of {OTUs} and provides the basis for improved quantification of covariate effects. The proposed method does not require prior normalization of {OTU} counts to adjust differences in sample total counts. Instead, the normalization and estimation of covariate effects on {OTU} abundance are simultaneously carried out for joint analysis of all {OTUs}. Using simulation studies and a real data analysis, we demonstrate improved inference compared to an existing method.}

abstract = {Recent human microbiome studies have revealed an essential role of the human microbiome in health and disease, opening up the possibility of building microbiome-based predictive models for individualized medicine. One unique characteristic of microbiome data is the existence of a phylogenetic tree that relates all the microbial species. It has frequently been observed that a cluster or clusters of bacteria at varying phylogenetic depths are associated with some clinical or biological outcome due to shared biological function (clustered signal). Moreover, in many cases, we observe a community-level change, where a large number of functionally interdependent species are associated with the outcome (dense signal). We thus develop "{glmmTree}," a prediction method based on a generalized linear mixed model framework, for capturing clustered and dense microbiome signals. {glmmTree} uses the similarity between microbiomes, which is defined based on the microbiome composition and the phylogenetic tree, to predict the outcome. The effects of other predictive variables (e.g., age, sex) can be incorporated readily in the regression framework. Additional tuning parameters enable a data-adaptive approach to capture signals at different phylogenetic depth and abundance level. Simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that "{glmmTree}" outperformed existing methods in the dense and clustered signal scenarios.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Artificial gut models provide unique opportunities to study human-associated microbiota. Outstanding questions for these models' fundamental biology include the timescales on which microbiota vary and the factors that drive such change. Answering these questions though requires overcoming analytical obstacles like estimating the effects of technical variation on observed microbiota dynamics, as well as the lack of appropriate benchmark datasets. {RESULTS}: To address these obstacles, we created a modeling framework based on multinomial logistic-normal dynamic linear models ({MALLARDs}) and performed dense longitudinal sampling of four replicate artificial human guts over the course of 1 month. The resulting analyses revealed how the ratio of biological variation to technical variation from sample processing depends on sampling frequency. In particular, we find that at hourly sampling frequencies, 76\% of observed variation could be ascribed to technical sources, which could also skew the observed covariation between taxa. We also found that the artificial guts demonstrated replicable trajectories even after a recovery from a transient feed disruption. Additionally, we observed irregular sub-daily oscillatory dynamics associated with the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae within all four replicate vessels. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our analyses suggest that, beyond variation due to sequence counting, technical variation from sample processing can obscure temporal variation from biological sources in artificial gut studies. Our analyses also supported hypotheses that human gut microbiota fluctuates on sub-daily timescales in the absence of a host and that microbiota can follow replicable trajectories in the presence of environmental driving forces. Finally, multiple aspects of our approach are generalizable and could ultimately be used to facilitate the design and analysis of longitudinal microbiota studies in vivo.}

The {eHOMD} provides well-curated {16S} {rRNA} gene reference sequences linked to available genomes and enables assignment of species-level taxonomy to most next-generation sequences derived from diverse aerodigestive tract sites, including the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth. Using minimum entropy decomposition coupled with the {RDP} Classifier and our {eHOMD} V1-V3 training set, we reanalyzed {16S} {rRNA} V1-V3 sequences from the nostrils of 210 Human Microbiome Project participants at the species level, revealing four key insights. First, we discovered that Lawsonella clevelandensis, a recently named bacterium, and Neisseriaceae [G-1] {HMT}-174, a previously unrecognized bacterium, are common in adult nostrils. Second, just 19 species accounted for 90\% of the total sequences from all participants. Third, 1 of these 19 species belonged to a currently uncultivated genus. Fourth, for 94\% of the participants, 2 to 10 species constituted 90\% of their sequences, indicating that the nostril microbiome may be represented by limited consortia. These insights highlight the strengths of the nostril microbiome as a model system for studying interspecies interactions and microbiome function. Also, in this cohort, three common nasal species (Dolosigranulum pigrum and two Corynebacterium species) showed positive differential abundance when the pathobiont Staphylococcus aureus was absent, generating hypotheses regarding colonization resistance. By facilitating species-level taxonomic assignment to microbes from the human aerodigestive tract, the {eHOMD} is a vital resource enhancing clinical relevance of microbiome studies. {IMPORTANCE} The {eHOMD} (http://www.ehomd.org) is a valuable resource for researchers, from basic to clinical, who study the microbiomes and the individual microbes in body sites in the human aerodigestive tract, which includes the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth, and the lower respiratory tract, in health and disease. The {eHOMD} is an actively curated, web-based, open-access resource. {eHOMD} provides the following: (i) species-level taxonomy based on grouping {16S} {rRNA} gene sequences at 98.5\% identity, (ii) a systematic naming scheme for unnamed and/or uncultivated microbial taxa, (iii) reference genomes to facilitate metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and proteomic studies and (iv) convenient cross-links to other databases (e.g., {PubMed} and Entrez).

abstract = {Abstract Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after {McArdle} and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for {ANOVA} (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by {McArdle} and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher?s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.}

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.}

abstract = {Summary. Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate {FDR} traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach?we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate {pFDR} and {FDR}, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that {pFDR} is probably the quantity of interest over {FDR}. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the {pFDR} analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini?Hochberg {FDR} method.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: People living with human immunodeficiency virus ({PLWH}) have been disproportionally affected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}) colonization and infection, in particular by clones {USA300} and {USA500}. However, the contribution of epidemiological, bacterial, and immunological risk factors to the excess of S aureus in {PLWH} remain incompletely understood. {METHODS}: In this cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S aureus colonization in 93 {PLWH} attending an urban human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) clinic. Participants completed a structured interview assessing demographic information and risk factors for {MRSA}. Swabs were obtained from the nose, throat, and groin and cultured for S aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. {RESULTS}: Most participants had well controlled {HIV} infection (89, 96\% {CD4} \textgreater200). Thirty-six (39\%) individuals were colonized with S aureus at 1 or more body sites, including 6 (6\%) with {MRSA}. Regular gym use was a risk factor for S aureus but not {MRSA} carriage. In contrast, S epidermidis was present in almost all individuals (n = 84, 90\%), predominantly in the nares (n = 66, 71\%). Using generalized estimating equation models, we observed that the odds of S aureus colonization were significantly and drastically reduced when S epidermidis was detected (P = .0001). After controlling for site, gender, and age, we identified that the odds of S aureus colonization were 80\% less if S epidermidis was present (adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95\% confidence interval, .09-.45; P \textless .0001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Taken together, we observed a lower prevalence of S aureus and {MRSA} colonization than has been previously reported in {PLWH}. In this cohort, colonization with S epidermidis was protective against S aureus colonization. \copyright The Author 2016.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lower respiratory tract infections ({LRTIs}) are a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Potentially pathogenic organisms are present in the respiratory tract in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children, but their presence does not necessarily indicate disease. We aimed to assess the concordance between upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota during {LRTIs} and the use of nasopharyngeal microbiota to discriminate {LRTIs} from health. {METHODS}: First, we did a prospective study of children aged between 4 weeks and 5 years who were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit ({PICU}) at Wilhelmina Children's Hospital (Utrecht, Netherlands) for a {WHO}-defined {LRTI} requiring mechanical ventilation. We obtained paired nasopharyngeal swabs and deep endotracheal aspirates from these participants (the so-called {PICU} cohort) between Sept 10, 2013, and Sept 4, 2016. We also did a matched case-control study (1:2) with the same inclusion criteria in children with {LRTIs} at three Dutch teaching hospitals and in age-matched, sex-matched, and time-matched healthy children recruited from the community. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at admission for cases and during home visits for controls. Data for child characteristics were obtained by questionnaires and from pharmacy printouts and medical charts. We used quantitative {PCR} and {16S} {rRNA}-based sequencing to establish viral and bacterial microbiota profiles, respectively. We did sparse random forest classifier analyses on the bacterial data, viral data, metadata, and the combination of all three datasets to distinguish cases from controls. {FINDINGS}: 29 patients were enrolled in the {PICU} cohort. Intra-individual concordance in terms of viral microbiota profiles (96\% agreement [95\% {CI} 93-99]) and bacterial microbiota profiles (58 taxa with a median Pearson's r 0·93 [{IQR} 0·62-0·99]; p\textless 0·05 for all 58 taxa) was high between nasopharyngeal and endotracheal aspirate samples, supporting the use of nasopharyngeal samples as proxy for lung microbiota during {LRTIs}. 154 cases and 307 matched controls were prospectively recruited to our case-control cohort. Individually, bacterial microbiota (area under the curve 0·77), viral microbiota (0·70), and child characteristics (0·80) poorly distinguished health from disease. However, a classification model based on combined bacterial and viral microbiota plus child characteristics distinguished children with {LRTIs} from their matched controls with a high degree of accuracy (area under the curve 0·92). {INTERPRETATION}: Our data suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiota can serve as a valid proxy for lower respiratory tract microbiota in childhood {LRTIs}, that clinical {LRTIs} in children result from the interplay between microbiota and host characteristics, rather than a single microorganism, and that microbiota-based diagnostics could improve future diagnostic and treatment protocols. {FUNDING}: Spaarne Gasthuis, University Medical Center Utrecht, and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.

Pathogens are presumed to originate from the nasopharyngeal ecosystem.Objectives: To investigate the association between early life respiratory microbiota and development of childhood {RTIs}.Methods: In a prospective birth cohort (Microbiome Utrecht Infant Study: {MUIS}), we characterized the oral microbiota longitudinally from birth until 6 months of age of 112 infants (nine regular samples/subject) and compared them with nasopharyngeal microbiota using {16S}-{rRNA}-based sequencing. We also characterized oral and nasopharynx samples during {RTI} episodes in the first half year of life.Measurements and Main Results: Oral microbiota were driven mostly by feeding type, followed by age, mode of delivery, and season of sampling. In contrast to our previously published associations between nasopharyngeal microbiota development and susceptibility to {RTIs}, oral microbiota development was not directly associated with susceptibility to {RTI} development. However, we did observe an influx of oral taxa, such as Neisseria lactamica, Streptococcus, Prevotella nanceiensis, Fusobacterium, and Janthinobacterium lividum, in the nasopharyngeal microbiota before and during {RTIs}, which was accompanied by reduced presence and abundance of Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, and Moraxella spp. Moreover, this phenomenon was accompanied by reduced niche differentiation indicating loss of ecological topography preceding confirmed {RTIs}. This loss of ecological topography was further augmented by start of daycare, and linked to consecutive development of symptomatic infections.Conclusions: Together, our results link the loss of topography to subsequent development of {RTI} episodes. This may lead to new insights for prevention of {RTIs} and antibiotic use in childhood.}

The objective here is to define the extent and possible reasons for geographic variation in the incidences of S. aureus-associated {VAP}, {MRSA}-{VAP} and overall {VAP}. A meta-regression model of S. aureus-associated {VAP} incidence per 1000 Mechanical Ventilation Days ({MVD}) was undertaken using random effects methods among publications obtained from a search of the English language literature. This model incorporated group level factors such as admission to a trauma {ICU}, year of publication and use of bronchoscopic sampling towards {VAP} diagnosis. The search identified 133 publications from seven worldwide regions published over three decades. The summary S. aureus-associated {VAP} incidence was 4.5 (3.9-5.3) per 1000 {MVD}. The highest S. aureus-associated {VAP} incidence is amongst reports from the Mediterranean (mean; 95\% confidence interval; 6.1; 4.1-8.5) versus that from Asian {ICUs} (2.1; 1.5-3.0). The incidence of S. aureus-associated {VAP} varies by up to three-fold (for the lowest versus highest incidence) among seven geographic regions worldwide, whereas the incidence of {VAP} varies by less than two-fold. Admission to a trauma unit is the most important group level correlate for S. aureus-associated {VAP}.}

Component groups from 66 studies of various interventions other than {SDD} provided additional points of reference.

The distinct properties of microbiome measurements include varied total sequence reads across samples, over-dispersion and zero-inflation. Additionally, microbiome studies usually collect samples longitudinally, which introduces time-dependent and correlation structures among the samples and thus further complicates the analysis and interpretation of microbiome count data. In this article, we propose negative binomial mixed models ({NBMMs}) for longitudinal microbiome studies. The proposed {NBMMs} can efficiently handle over-dispersion and varying total reads, and can account for the dynamic trend and correlation among longitudinal samples. We develop an efficient and stable algorithm to fit the {NBMMs}. We evaluate and demonstrate the {NBMMs} method via extensive simulation studies and application to a longitudinal microbiome data. The results show that the proposed method has desirable properties and outperform the previously used methods in terms of flexible framework for modeling correlation structures and detecting dynamic effects. We have developed an R package {NBZIMM} to implement the proposed method, which is freely available from the public {GitHub} repository http://github.com//nyiuab//{NBZIMM} and provides a useful tool for analyzing longitudinal microbiome data.}

Phage therapy is a promising alternative antibacterial strategy.Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous phage therapy for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in rats.Methods: In a randomized, blinded, controlled experimental study, we compared intravenous teicoplanin (3 mg/kg, n = 12), a cocktail of four phages (2-3 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml of 2003, 2002, {3A}, and K; n = 12), and a combination of both (n = 11) given 2, 12, and 24 hours after induction of pneumonia, and then once daily for 4 days. The primary outcome was survival at Day 4. Secondary outcomes were bacterial and phage densities in lungs and spleen, histopathological scoring of infection within the lungs, and inflammatory biomarkers in blood.Measurements and Main Results: Treatment with either phages or teicoplanin increased survival from 0\% to 58\% and 50\%, respectively (P \textless  0.005). The combination of phages and antibiotics did not further improve outcomes (45\% survival). Animal survival correlated with reduced bacterial burdens in the lung (1.2 × 106 cfu/g of tissue for survivors vs. 1.2 × 109 cfu/g for nonsurviving animals; P \textless  0.0001), as well as improved histopathological outcomes. Phage multiplication within the lung occurred during treatment. {IL}-1\beta increased in all treatment groups over the course of therapy.Conclusions: Phage therapy was as effective as teicoplanin in improving survival and decreasing bacterial load within the lungs of rats infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Combining antibiotics with phage therapy did not further improve outcomes.}

abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Pneumococcal pneumonia remains a global health problem. Colonization of the nasopharynx with S.pneumoniae (Spn), although, a prerequisite of infection, is the main source of exposure and immunological boosting in children and adults. However, our knowledge of how nasal colonization impacts on the lung cells, especially on the predominant alveolar macrophage ({AM}) population, is limited. {OBJECTIVES}: Using a Controlled Human Infection Model to achieve nasal colonization with {6B} serotype, we investigated the effect of Spn colonization on lung cells. {METHODS}: We collected bronchoalveolar lavages from healthy pneumococcal challenged participants aged 18-49 years. Confocal microscopy, molecular and classical microbiology were used to investigate microaspiration and pneumococcal presence in the lower airways. {AM} opsonophagocytic capacity was assessed by functional assays in vitro, whereas flow cytometry and transcriptomic analysis were used to assess further changes on the lung cellular populations. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: {AM} from Spn-colonized exhibited increased opsonophagocytosis to pneumococcus (11.4\% median increase) for four months after clearance of experimental pneumococcal colonization. {AM} had also increased responses against other bacterial pathogens. Pneumococcal {DNA} detected in the {BAL} samples of Spn-colonized were positively correlated with nasal pneumococcal density (r=0.71, p=0.029). Similarly, {AM} heightened opsonophagocytic capacity was correlated with nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density (r=0.61, p=0.025). {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings demonstrate that nasal colonization with pneumococcus and microaspiration prime {AM}, leading to brisker responsiveness to both pneumococcus and unrelated bacterial pathogens. The relative abundance of {AM} in the alveolar spaces, alongside with their potential for non-specific protection, render them an attractive target for novel vaccines.

abstract = {Abstract Bayesian data analysis is about more than just computing a posterior distribution, and Bayesian visualization is about more than trace plots of Markov chains. Practical Bayesian data analysis, like all data analysis, is an iterative process of model building, inference, model checking and evaluation, and model expansion. Visualization is helpful in each of these stages of the Bayesian workflow and it is indispensable when drawing inferences from the types of modern, high dimensional models that are used by applied researchers.}

abstract = {This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and {RStudio}. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specificationsuperimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scalesadd customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regressionsave any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reusecreate custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plotsapproach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.}

abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Recent studies have revealed that in critically ill patients, lung microbiota are altered and correlate with alveolar inflammation. The clinical significance of altered lung bacteria in critical illness is unknown. {OBJECTIVES}: To determine if clinical outcomes of critically ill patients are predicted by features of the lung microbiome at the time of admission. {METHODS}: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in an intensive care unit ({ICU}) at a university hospital. Lung microbiota were quantified and characterized using droplet digital {PCR} and bacterial {16S} {rRNA} gene sequencing. Primary predictors were the bacterial burden, community diversity, and community composition of lung microbiota. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days, determined at 28 days post admission. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Lungs of 91 critically ill patients were sampled using miniature-bronchoalveolar lavage within 24 hours of {ICU} admission. Patients with increased bacterial lung bacterial burden had fewer ventilator-free days ({HR} 0.43, {CI} 0.21-0.88), which remained significant when controlled for pneumonia and severity of illness. The community composition of lung bacteria predicted ventilator-free days (P=0.003), driven by the presence of gut-associated bacteria (e.g. Lachnospiraceae and Enterobacteriaceae spp.). Detection of gut-associated bacteria was also associated with the presence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. {CONCLUSIONS}: Key features of the lung microbiome (bacterial burden, enrichment with gut-associated bacteria) predict outcomes in critically ill patients. The lung microbiome is an understudied source of clinical variation in critical illness, and represents a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory failure.}

abstract = {Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

We review methods of inference from simulations in order to develop convergence-monitoring summaries that are relevant for the purposes for which the simulations are used. We recommend applying a battery of tests for mixing based on the comparison of inferences from individual sequences and from the mixture of sequences. Finally, we discuss multivariate analogues, for assessing convergence of several parameters simultaneously.}
