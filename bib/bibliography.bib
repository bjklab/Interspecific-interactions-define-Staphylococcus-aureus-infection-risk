               Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov
               chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an
               adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized

               platform for computing log densities and their gradients and
               Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as

              center from January 2009 to July 2011. All patients with
              confirmed pneumonia who had both a nasal swab MRSA PCR test and a
              bacterial culture within predefined time intervals were included
              in the study. These data were used to calculate sensitivity,

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Recent studies have revealed that in critically ill
              patients, lung microbiota are altered and correlate with alveolar
              inflammation. The clinical significance of altered lung bacteria
              in critical illness is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if
              clinical outcomes of critically ill patients are predicted by
              features of the lung microbiome at the time of admission.
              METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in
              an intensive care unit (ICU) at a university hospital. Lung
              microbiota were quantified and characterized using droplet
              digital PCR and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Primary
              predictors were the bacterial burden, community diversity, and
              community composition of lung microbiota. The primary outcome was
              ventilator-free days, determined at 28 days post admission.
              MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lungs of 91 critically ill
              patients were sampled using miniature-bronchoalveolar lavage
              within 24 hours of ICU admission. Patients with increased
              bacterial lung bacterial burden had fewer ventilator-free days
              (HR 0.43, CI 0.21-0.88), which remained significant when
              controlled for pneumonia and severity of illness. The community
              composition of lung bacteria predicted ventilator-free days
              (P=0.003), driven by the presence of gut-associated bacteria
              (e.g. Lachnospiraceae and Enterobacteriaceae spp.). Detection of
              gut-associated bacteria was also associated with the presence of
              the acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Key
              features of the lung microbiome (bacterial burden, enrichment
              with gut-associated bacteria) predict outcomes in critically ill
              patients. The lung microbiome is an understudied source of
              clinical variation in critical illness, and represents a novel
              therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of acute
              respiratory failure.",

              comprehensive microbiome database for sites along the human
              aerodigestive tract that revealed new insights into the nostril
              microbiome. The eHOMD provides well-curated 16S rRNA gene
              reference sequences linked to available genomes and enables
              assignment of species-level taxonomy to most next-generation
              sequences derived from diverse aerodigestive tract sites,
              including the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and
              mouth. Using minimum entropy decomposition coupled with the RDP
              Classifier and our eHOMD V1-V3 training set, we reanalyzed 16S
              rRNA V1-V3 sequences from the nostrils of 210 Human Microbiome
              Project participants at the species level, revealing four key
              insights. First, we discovered that Lawsonella clevelandensis, a
              recently named bacterium, and Neisseriaceae [G-1] HMT-174, a
              previously unrecognized bacterium, are common in adult nostrils.
              Second, just 19 species accounted for 90\% of the total sequences
              from all participants. Third, 1 of these 19 species belonged to a
              currently uncultivated genus. Fourth, for 94\% of the
              participants, 2 to 10 species constituted 90\% of their
              sequences, indicating that the nostril microbiome may be
              represented by limited consortia. These insights highlight the
              strengths of the nostril microbiome as a model system for
              studying interspecies interactions and microbiome function. Also,
              in this cohort, three common nasal species (Dolosigranulum pigrum
              and two Corynebacterium species) showed positive differential
              abundance when the pathobiont Staphylococcus aureus was absent,
              generating hypotheses regarding colonization resistance. By
              facilitating species-level taxonomic assignment to microbes from
              the human aerodigestive tract, the eHOMD is a vital resource

              species-level taxonomy based on grouping 16S rRNA gene sequences
              at 98.5\% identity, (ii) a systematic naming scheme for unnamed
              and/or uncultivated microbial taxa, (iii) reference genomes to
              facilitate metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and proteomic studies
              and (iv) convenient cross-links to other databases (e.g., PubMed
              and Entrez). By facilitating the assignment of species names to
              sequences, the eHOMD is a vital resource for enhancing the
              clinical relevance of 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome studies, as
              well as metagenomic studies.",

  abstract = "High-throughput sequencing based techniques, such as 16S rRNA
              gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner
              workings of natural microbial communities - be they from the
              world's oceans or the human gut. A key step in exploring such
              data is the identification of dependencies between members of
              these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation
              analysis. However, it has been known since the days of Karl
              Pearson that the analysis of the type of data generated by such
              techniques (referred to as compositional data) can produce
              unreliable results since the observed data take the form of
              relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their
              absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human
              Microbiome Project, we show that such compositional effects can
              be widespread and severe: in some real data sets many of the
              correlations among taxa can be artifactual, and true correlations
              may even appear with opposite sign. Additionally, we show that
              community diversity is the key factor that modulates the
              acuteness of such compositional effects, and develop a new
              approach, called SparCC (available at
              https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc), which is capable of
              estimating correlation values from compositional data. To
              illustrate a potential application of SparCC, we infer a rich
              ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species
              across 18 sites on the human body. Using the SparCC network as a
              reference, we estimated that the standard approach yields 3
              spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction
              and misses 60\% of the true interactions in the human microbiome
              data, and, as predicted, most of the erroneous links are found in
              the samples with the lowest diversity.",

              hospitals continues to be a frequent and serious complication to
              hospitalization, and no previous case-control studies dealing
              with risk factors of this severe disease are available. METHODS:
              Based on a 1-year prospective analysis, the data from all
              patients with hospital-acquired SAB admitted to 4 hospitals in
              Copenhagen County, Denmark, from May 1, 1994, through April 30,
              1995, were evaluated. Eighty-five patients with hospital-acquired
              SAB were matched to 85 control patients with a similar primary
              diagnosis at admission (matched controls). Of these, 62 patients
              with hospital-acquired SAB were compared with 118 other patients
              with a similar time of admission, who were randomly selected with
              no clinical evidence of SAB (unmatched controls). RESULTS: The
              incidence of hospital-acquired SAB was 0.71 per 1000 hospital
              admissions. The presence of a central venous catheter (odds
              ratio, 6.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-17.0), anemia
              (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% CI, 1.4-7.6), and hyponatremia (odds
              ratio, 3.3; 95\% CI, 1.5-7.0) was significantly associated with
              hospital-acquired SAB in a conditional and a usual logistic
              regression analysis. Nasal carriage was not an independent risk
              factor, but nasal carriers among patients in surgery (odds ratio,
              4.0; 95\% CI, 1.3-13.0) had a significantly higher risk for
              hospital-acquired SAB compared with matched and unmatched
              controls. The presence of hospital-acquired SAB increased the
              mortality rate 2.4-fold (95\% CI, 1.1-5.2). CONCLUSIONS: The
              presence of a central venous catheter is an important risk
              factor, and hyponatremia and anemia are associated with the
              development of hospital-acquired SAB. Furthermore,
              hospital-acquired SAB in itself increases mortality.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major
              contributor to respiratory failure requiring intubation and
              mechanical ventilation. LRTI also occurs during mechanical
              ventilation, increasing the morbidity and mortality of intubated
              patients. We sought to understand the dynamics of respiratory
              tract microbiota following intubation and the relationship
              between microbial community structure and infection. RESULTS: We
              enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory failure
              requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical
              intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal
              (OP) and deep endotracheal (ET) secretions were sampled within 24
              h of intubation and every 48-72 h thereafter. Bacterial community
              profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of
              16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and
              bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects
              to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract
              sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper
              respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in
              healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial
              diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time
              on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community
              was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The
              clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated
              with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon.
              Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures
              were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa
              included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma
              parvum and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal
              analysis of respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill
              patients provides insight into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of
              LRTI. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of endotracheal aspirate samples
              holds promise for expanded pathogen identification.",

  abstract = "The successional dynamics of microbial communities are influenced
              by the synergistic interactions of physical and biological
              factors. In our motivating data, ocean microbiome samples were
              collected from the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf, Monterey Bay at
              multiple time points and then 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequenced.
              We develop a Bayesian semiparametric regression model to
              investigate how microbial abundance and succession change with
              covarying physical and biological factors including algal bloom
              and domoic acid concentration level using 16S rRNA sequencing
              data. A generalized linear regression model is built using the
              Laplace prior, a sparse inducing prior, to improve estimation of
              covariate effects on mean abundances of microbial species
              represented by operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A
              nonparametric prior model is used to facilitate borrowing
              strength across OTUs, across samples and across time points. It
              flexibly estimates baseline mean abundances of OTUs and provides
              the basis for improved quantification of covariate effects. The
              proposed method does not require prior normalization of OTU
              counts to adjust differences in sample total counts. Instead, the
              normalization and estimation of covariate effects on OTU
              abundance are simultaneously carried out for joint analysis of
              all OTUs. Using simulation studies and a real data analysis, we
              demonstrate improved inference compared to an existing method.",

              microbiota of the nostril and posterior wall of the oropharynx
              from seven healthy adults using two culture-independent methods,
              a 16S rRNA gene microarray (PhyloChip) and 16S rRNA gene clone
              libraries. While the bacterial microbiota of the oropharynx was
              richer than that of the nostril, the oropharyngeal microbiota
              varied less among participants than did nostril microbiota. A few
              phyla accounted for the majority of the bacteria detected at each
              site: Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the nostril and
              Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx.
              Compared to culture-independent surveys of microbiota from other
              body sites, the microbiota of the nostril and oropharynx show
              distinct phylum-level distribution patterns, supporting
              niche-specific colonization at discrete anatomical sites. In the
              nostril, the distribution of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes was
              reminiscent of that of skin, though Proteobacteria were much less
              prevalent. The distribution of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and
              Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx was most similar to that in
              saliva, with more Proteobacteria than in the distal esophagus or
              mouth. While Firmicutes were prevalent at both sites, distinct
              families within this phylum dominated numerically in each. At
              both sites there was an inverse correlation between the
              prevalences of Firmicutes and another phylum: in the oropharynx,
              Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and in the nostril, Firmicutes and
              Actinobacteria. In the nostril, this inverse correlation existed
              between the Firmicutes family Staphylococcaceae and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a
              leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Potentially
              pathogenic organisms are present in the respiratory tract in both
              symptomatic and asymptomatic children, but their presence does
              not necessarily indicate disease. We aimed to assess the
              concordance between upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota
              during LRTIs and the use of nasopharyngeal microbiota to
              discriminate LRTIs from health. METHODS: First, we did a
              prospective study of children aged between 4 weeks and 5 years
              who were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at
              Wilhelmina Children's Hospital (Utrecht, Netherlands) for a
              WHO-defined LRTI requiring mechanical ventilation. We obtained
              paired nasopharyngeal swabs and deep endotracheal aspirates from
              these participants (the so-called PICU cohort) between Sept 10,
              2013, and Sept 4, 2016. We also did a matched case-control study
              (1:2) with the same inclusion criteria in children with LRTIs at
              three Dutch teaching hospitals and in age-matched, sex-matched,
              and time-matched healthy children recruited from the community.
              Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at admission for cases and
              during home visits for controls. Data for child characteristics
              were obtained by questionnaires and from pharmacy printouts and
              medical charts. We used quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA-based
              sequencing to establish viral and bacterial microbiota profiles,
              respectively. We did sparse random forest classifier analyses on
              the bacterial data, viral data, metadata, and the combination of
              all three datasets to distinguish cases from controls. FINDINGS:
              29 patients were enrolled in the PICU cohort. Intra-individual
              concordance in terms of viral microbiota profiles (96\% agreement
              [95\% CI 93-99]) and bacterial microbiota profiles (58 taxa with
              a median Pearson's r 0·93 [IQR 0·62-0·99]; p<0·05 for all 58
              taxa) was high between nasopharyngeal and endotracheal aspirate
              samples, supporting the use of nasopharyngeal samples as proxy
              for lung microbiota during LRTIs. 154 cases and 307 matched
              controls were prospectively recruited to our case-control cohort.
              Individually, bacterial microbiota (area under the curve 0·77),
              viral microbiota (0·70), and child characteristics (0·80) poorly
              distinguished health from disease. However, a classification
              model based on combined bacterial and viral microbiota plus child
              characteristics distinguished children with LRTIs from their
              matched controls with a high degree of accuracy (area under the
              curve 0·92). INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that the
              nasopharyngeal microbiota can serve as a valid proxy for lower
              respiratory tract microbiota in childhood LRTIs, that clinical
              LRTIs in children result from the interplay between microbiota
              and host characteristics, rather than a single microorganism, and
              that microbiota-based diagnostics could improve future diagnostic
              and treatment protocols. FUNDING: Spaarne Gasthuis, University

              appreciated as an important mediator in the susceptibility to
              childhood respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Pathogens are
              presumed to originate from the nasopharyngeal
              ecosystem.Objectives: To investigate the association between
              early life respiratory microbiota and development of childhood
              RTIs.Methods: In a prospective birth cohort (Microbiome Utrecht
              Infant Study: MUIS), we characterized the oral microbiota
              longitudinally from birth until 6 months of age of 112 infants
              (nine regular samples/subject) and compared them with
              nasopharyngeal microbiota using 16S-rRNA-based sequencing. We
              also characterized oral and nasopharynx samples during RTI
              episodes in the first half year of life.Measurements and Main
              Results: Oral microbiota were driven mostly by feeding type,
              followed by age, mode of delivery, and season of sampling. In
              contrast to our previously published associations between
              nasopharyngeal microbiota development and susceptibility to RTIs,
              oral microbiota development was not directly associated with
              susceptibility to RTI development. However, we did observe an
              influx of oral taxa, such as Neisseria lactamica, Streptococcus,
              Prevotella nanceiensis, Fusobacterium, and Janthinobacterium
              lividum, in the nasopharyngeal microbiota before and during RTIs,
              which was accompanied by reduced presence and abundance of
              Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, and Moraxella spp. Moreover,
              this phenomenon was accompanied by reduced niche differentiation
              indicating loss of ecological topography preceding confirmed
              RTIs. This loss of ecological topography was further augmented by
              start of daycare, and linked to consecutive development of
              symptomatic infections.Conclusions: Together, our results link
              the loss of topography to subsequent development of RTI episodes.
              This may lead to new insights for prevention of RTIs and
              antibiotic use in childhood.",

              problem. Colonization of the nasopharynx with Streptococcus
              pneumoniae (Spn), although a prerequisite of infection, is the
              main source of exposure and immunological boosting in children
              and adults. However, our knowledge of how nasal colonization
              impacts on the lung cells, especially on the predominant alveolar
              macrophage (AM) population, is limited.Objectives: Using a
              controlled human infection model to achieve nasal colonization
              with 6B serotype, we investigated the effect of Spn colonization
              on lung cells.Methods: We collected BAL from healthy
              pneumococcal-challenged participants aged 18-49 years. Confocal
              microscopy and molecular and classical microbiology were used to
              investigate microaspiration and pneumococcal presence in the
              lower airways. AM opsonophagocytic capacity was assessed by
              functional assays in vitro, whereas flow cytometry and
              transcriptomic analysis were used to assess further changes on
              the lung cellular populations.Measurements and Main Results: AMs
              from Spn-colonized individuals exhibited increased
              opsonophagocytosis to pneumococcus (11.4\% median increase) for
              approximately 3 months after experimental pneumococcal
              colonization. AMs also had increased responses against other
              bacterial pathogens. Pneumococcal DNA detected in the BAL samples
              of Spn-colonized individuals were positively correlated with
              nasal pneumococcal density (r = 0.71; P = 0.029). Similarly,
              AM-heightened opsonophagocytic capacity was correlated with
              nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density (r = 0.61, P =
              0.025).Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that nasal
              colonization with pneumococcus and microaspiration prime AMs,
              leading to brisker responsiveness to both pneumococcus and
              unrelated bacterial pathogens. The relative abundance of AMs in
              the alveolar spaces, alongside their potential for nonspecific
              protection, render them an attractive target for novel vaccines.",

              teicoplanin (3 mg/kg, n = 12), a cocktail of four phages (2-3
              $\times$ 109 plaque-forming units/ml of 2003, 2002, 3A, and K; n
              = 12), and a combination of both (n = 11) given 2, 12, and 24
              hours after induction of pneumonia, and then once daily for 4
              days. The primary outcome was survival at Day 4. Secondary
              outcomes were bacterial and phage densities in lungs and spleen,
              histopathological scoring of infection within the lungs, and
              inflammatory biomarkers in blood.Measurements and Main Results:
              Treatment with either phages or teicoplanin increased survival
              from 0\% to 58\% and 50\%, respectively (P < 0.005). The
              combination of phages and antibiotics did not further improve

              outcomes from commensalism to pathogenesis. S. aureus is a
              clinically important pathogen that asymptomatically colonizes
              ~25\% of humans as a member of the nostril and skin microbiota,
              where it resides with other bacteria including commensal
              Corynebacterium species. Commensal Corynebacterium spp. are also
              positively correlated with S. aureus in chronic polymicrobial
              diabetic foot infections, distinct from acute monomicrobial S.
              aureus infections. Recent work by our lab and others indicates
              that microbe-microbe interactions between S. aureus and human
              skin/nasal commensals, including Corynebacterium species, affect
              S. aureus behavior and fitness. Thus, we hypothesized that S.
              aureus interactions with Corynebacterium spp. diminish S. aureus
              virulence. We tested this by assaying for changes in S. aureus
              gene expression during in vitro mono- versus coculture with
              Corynebacterium striatum, a common skin and nasal commensal. We
              observed a broad shift in S. aureus gene transcription during in
              vitro growth with C. striatum, including increased transcription
              of genes known to exhibit increased expression during human nasal
              colonization and decreased transcription of virulence genes. S.
              aureus uses several regulatory pathways to transition between
              commensal and pathogenic states. One of these, the quorum signal
              accessory gene regulator (agr) system, was strongly inhibited in
              response to Corynebacterium spp. Phenotypically, S. aureus
              exposed to C. striatum exhibited increased adhesion to epithelial
              cells, reflecting a commensal state, and decreased hemolysin
              activity, reflecting an attenuation of virulence. Consistent with
              this, S. aureus displayed diminished fitness in experimental in
              vivo coinfection with C. striatum when compared to monoinfection.
              These data support a model in which S. aureus shifts from
              virulence toward a commensal state when exposed to commensal
              Corynebacterium species.",

               Yet, statistical artifacts commonly plague the analysis of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Artificial gut models provide unique opportunities to
              study human-associated microbiota. Outstanding questions for
              these models' fundamental biology include the timescales on which
              microbiota vary and the factors that drive such change. Answering
              these questions though requires overcoming analytical obstacles
              like estimating the effects of technical variation on observed
              microbiota dynamics, as well as the lack of appropriate benchmark
              datasets. RESULTS: To address these obstacles, we created a
              modeling framework based on multinomial logistic-normal dynamic
              linear models (MALLARDs) and performed dense longitudinal
              sampling of four replicate artificial human guts over the course
              of 1 month. The resulting analyses revealed how the ratio of
              biological variation to technical variation from sample
              processing depends on sampling frequency. In particular, we find
              that at hourly sampling frequencies, 76\% of observed variation
              could be ascribed to technical sources, which could also skew the
              observed covariation between taxa. We also found that the
              artificial guts demonstrated replicable trajectories even after a
              recovery from a transient feed disruption. Additionally, we
              observed irregular sub-daily oscillatory dynamics associated with
              the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae within all four replicate
              vessels. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that, beyond variation
              due to sequence counting, technical variation from sample
              processing can obscure temporal variation from biological sources
              in artificial gut studies. Our analyses also supported hypotheses
              that human gut microbiota fluctuates on sub-daily timescales in
              the absence of a host and that microbiota can follow replicable
              trajectories in the presence of environmental driving forces.
              Finally, multiple aspects of our approach are generalizable and
              could ultimately be used to facilitate the design and analysis of

               complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we
               typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis
               test, a compound error rate is controlled for
               multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false
               discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential
               p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a
               sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its
               corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite
               approach-we fix the rejection region and then estimate its
               corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased
               applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to
               both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide
               evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the
               quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation
               of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which

               traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented

              predisposes to the development of ventilator-associated
              tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia
              (VAP). Despite extensive antibiotic treatment of intensive care
              unit patients, limited data are available on the efficacy of

              infections. Therefore, microbiologic responses to antibiotic
              treatment were evaluated in ventilated patients. Methods: Results
              of semiquantitative analyses of S. aureus burden in serial
              endotracheal-aspirate (ETA) samples and VAT/VAP diagnosis were
              correlated to antibiotic treatment. Minimum inhibitory
              concentrations of relevant antibiotics using serially collected
              isolates were evaluated. Results: Forty-eight mechanically
              ventilated patients who were S. aureus positive by ETA samples
              and treated with relevant antibiotics for at least 2 consecutive
              days were included in the study. Vancomycin failed to reduce
              methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-susceptible
              S. aureus (MSSA) burden in the airways. Oxacillin was ineffective
              for MSSA colonization in approximately 30\% of the patients, and
              responders were typically coadministered additional antibiotics.
              Despite antibiotic exposure, 15 of the 39 patients (approximately
              38\%) colonized only by S. aureus and treated with appropriate
              antibiotic for at least 2 days still progressed to VAP.
              Importantly, no change in antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus
              isolates was observed during treatment. Staphylococcus aureus
              colonization levels inversely correlated with the presence of
              normal respiratory flora. Conclusions: Antibiotic treatment is
              ineffective in reducing S. aureus colonization in the lower
              airways and preventing VAT or VAP. Staphylococcus aureus is in
              competition for colonization with the normal respiratory flora.

              However, the contribution of epidemiological, bacterial, and
              immunological risk factors to the excess of S aureus in PLWH
              remain incompletely understood. METHODS: In this cross-sectional
              study, we determined the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of
              S aureus colonization in 93 PLWH attending an urban human
              immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinic. Participants completed a
              structured interview assessing demographic information and risk
              factors for MRSA. Swabs were obtained from the nose, throat, and
              groin and cultured for S aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
              RESULTS: Most participants had well controlled HIV infection (89,
              96\% CD4 >200). Thirty-six (39\%) individuals were colonized with
              S aureus at 1 or more body sites, including 6 (6\%) with MRSA.
              Regular gym use was a risk factor for S aureus but not MRSA
              carriage. In contrast, S epidermidis was present in almost all
              individuals (n = 84, 90\%), predominantly in the nares (n = 66,
              71\%). Using generalized estimating equation models, we observed
              that the odds of S aureus colonization were significantly and
              drastically reduced when S epidermidis was detected (P = .0001).
              After controlling for site, gender, and age, we identified that
              the odds of S aureus colonization were 80\% less if S epidermidis
              was present (adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95\% confidence interval,
              .09-.45; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we observed a
              lower prevalence of S aureus and MRSA colonization than has been
              previously reported in PLWH. In this cohort, colonization with S
              epidermidis was protective against S aureus colonization.",

  abstract = "Summary Joint species distribution models (JSDM) are increasingly
              used to analyse community ecology data. Recent progress with
              JSDMs has provided ecologists with new tools for estimating
              species associations (residual co-occurrence patterns after
              accounting for environmental niches) from large data sets, as
              well as for increasing the predictive power of species
              distribution models (SDMs) by accounting for such associations.
              Yet, one critical limitation of JSDMs developed thus far is that
              they assume constant species associations. However, in real
              ecological communities, the direction and strength of
              interspecific interactions are likely to be different under
              different environmental conditions. In this paper, we overcome
              the shortcoming of present JSDMs by allowing species associations
              covary with measured environmental covariates. To estimate
              environmental-dependent species associations, we utilize a latent
              variable structure, where the factor loadings are modelled as a
              linear regression to environmental covariates. We illustrate the
              performance of the statistical framework with both simulated and
              real data. Our results show that JSDMs perform substantially
              better in inferring environmental-dependent species associations
              than single SDMs, especially with sparse data. Furthermore, JSDMs
              consistently overperform SDMs in terms of predictive power for
              generating predictions that account for environment-dependent
              biotic associations. We implemented the statistical framework as
              a MATLAB package, which includes tools both for model
              parameterization as well as for post-processing of results,
              particularly for addressing whether and how species associations
              depend on the environmental conditions. Our statistical framework
              provides a new tool for ecologists who wish to investigate from
              non-manipulative observational community data the dependency of
              interspecific interactions on environmental context. Our method
              can be applied to answer the fundamental questions in community
              ecology about how species? interactions shift in changing
              environmental conditions, as well as to predict future changes of
              species? interactions in response to global change.",

  abstract = "Recent human microbiome studies have revealed an essential role
              of the human microbiome in health and disease, opening up the
              possibility of building microbiome-based predictive models for
              individualized medicine. One unique characteristic of microbiome
              data is the existence of a phylogenetic tree that relates all the
              microbial species. It has frequently been observed that a cluster
              or clusters of bacteria at varying phylogenetic depths are
              associated with some clinical or biological outcome due to shared
              biological function (clustered signal). Moreover, in many cases,
              we observe a community-level change, where a large number of
              functionally interdependent species are associated with the
              outcome (dense signal). We thus develop ``glmmTree,'' a
              prediction method based on a generalized linear mixed model
              framework, for capturing clustered and dense microbiome signals.
              glmmTree uses the similarity between microbiomes, which is
              defined based on the microbiome composition and the phylogenetic
              tree, to predict the outcome. The effects of other predictive
              variables (e.g., age, sex) can be incorporated readily in the
              regression framework. Additional tuning parameters enable a
              data-adaptive approach to capture signals at different
              phylogenetic depth and abundance level. Simulation studies and
              real data applications demonstrated that ``glmmTree''
              outperformed existing methods in the dense and clustered signal
              scenarios.",

              has been conceived to provide a useful tool especially for the
              scientific microbial taxonomist community. The aim of what we
              have called ``The All-Species Living Tree'' is to reconstruct a
              single 16S rRNA tree harboring all sequenced type strains of the
              hitherto classified species of Archaea and Bacteria. This tree is
              to be regularly updated by adding the species with validly
              published names that appear monthly in the Validation and
              Notification lists of the International Journal of Systematic and
              Evolutionary Microbiology. For this purpose, the SAM executive
              editors, together with the responsible teams of the ARB, SILVA,
              and LPSN projects (www.arb-home.de, www.arb-silva.de, and
              www.bacterio.cict.fr, respectively), have prepared a 16S rRNA
              database containing over 6700 sequences, each of which represents
              a single type strain of a classified species up to 31 December
              2007. The selection of sequences had to be undertaken manually
              due to a high error rate in the names and information fields
              provided for the publicly deposited entries. In addition, from
              among the often occurring multiple entries for a single type
              strain, the best-quality sequence was selected for the project.
              The living tree database that SAM now provides contains corrected
              entries and the best-quality sequences with a manually checked
              alignment. The tree reconstruction has been performed by using
              the maximum likelihood algorithm RAxML. The tree provided in the
              first release is a result of the calculation of a single dataset
              containing 9975 single entries, 6728 corresponding to type strain
              gene sequences, as well as 3247 additional high-fquality
              sequences to give robustness to the reconstruction. Trees are
              dynamic structures that change on the basis of the quality and
              availability of the data used for their calculation. Therefore,
              the addition of new type strain sequences in further subsequent
              releases may help to resolve certain branching orders that appear
              ambiguous in this first release. On the web sites:
              www.elsevier.de/syapm and www.arb-silva.de/living-tree, the
              All-Species Living Tree team will release a regularly updated
              database compatible with the ARB software environment containing
              the whole 16S rRNA dataset used to reconstruct ``The All-Species
              Living Tree''. As a result, the latest reconstructed phylogeny
              will be provided. In addition to the ARB file, a readable
              multi-FASTA universal sequence editor file with the complete
              alignment will be provided for those not using ARB. There is also
              a complete set of supplementary tables and figures illustrating
              the selection procedure and its outcome. It is expected that the
              All-Species Living Tree will help to improve future
              classification efforts by simplifying the selection of the
              correct type strain sequences. For queries, information updates,
              remarks on the dataset or tree reconstructions shown, a contact
              email address has been created (living-tree@arb-silva.de). This
              provides an entry point for anyone from the scientific community
              to provide additional input for the construction and improvement
              of the first tree compiling all sequenced type strains of all
              prokaryotic species for which names had been validly published.",

              investigating the associations between the microbiome and host
              environmental/clinical factors and the dynamic changes of
              microbial abundance over time. The distinct properties of
              microbiome measurements include varied total sequence reads
              across samples, over-dispersion and zero-inflation. Additionally,
              microbiome studies usually collect samples longitudinally, which
              introduces time-dependent and correlation structures among the
              samples and thus further complicates the analysis and
              interpretation of microbiome count data. In this article, we
              propose negative binomial mixed models (NBMMs) for longitudinal
              microbiome studies. The proposed NBMMs can efficiently handle
              over-dispersion and varying total reads, and can account for the
              dynamic trend and correlation among longitudinal samples. We
              develop an efficient and stable algorithm to fit the NBMMs. We
              evaluate and demonstrate the NBMMs method via extensive
              simulation studies and application to a longitudinal microbiome
              data. The results show that the proposed method has desirable
              properties and outperform the previously used methods in terms of
              flexible framework for modeling correlation structures and
              detecting dynamic effects. We have developed an R package NBZIMM

              the public GitHub repository http://github.com//nyiuab//NBZIMM
